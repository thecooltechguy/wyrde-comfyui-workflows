# wyrde's basic basics of comfy workflows

## Keyboard shortcuts

```
    Ctrl + A   = select all nodes
    Ctrl + M   = mute/unmute selected nodes
    Ctrl + C   = copy selected nodes
    Ctrl + V   = paste node buffer
    Delete     = delete selected nodes
    Backspace  = delete selected nodes
    Space Bar  = drag viewing area (hold space bar and move mouse pointer)

```
Notes:
* Ctrl + X does nothing.
* muted nodes don't process and block everythintg behind them 

## Organization
* [Templates can be added from this repo](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts). Download (don't copy paste the editor display, save the raw file) the node-templates file and put it in ComfyUI/web/extensions/.
* noodles (the wires) can be organized with _reroute_ nodes. It takes extra time, but it makes figuring out a workflow a few days later much easier. Much less someone else.

##
This directory conatains some basic workflows showing beginning principles. Think of them as badly organized tutorials.

Be sure to check out the [comfy examples](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/) as well!
