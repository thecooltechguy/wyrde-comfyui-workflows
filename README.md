## Custom Nodes and Extensions
Some places for ComfyUI stuff much cooler than mine:
* [WAS node suite](https://github.com/WASasquatch/was-node-suite-comfyui)
  * development is ended, but nodes are still useful
* https://github.com/lilly1987/ComfyUI_node_Lilly
  * Lots of amazing things which are beyond me
* https://github.com/lilly1987/ComfyUI-workflow
  * more workflows!
* https://github.com/guoyk93/yk-node-suite-comfyui
* https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts

* https://github.com/diontimmer/ComfyUI-Vextra-Nodes

* Many custom nodes are provided as packages on [civitai](https://civitai.com/). Use the "other" type in filters or search with the [comfyui](https://civitai.com/?query=comfyui) tag. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9657443/232229734-e1e662f5-d534-413d-9a05-24a09abfef20.png" width="25%" align="middle">
* A litle more information on custom nodes and extensions in [basics](./basics)

If you install custom nodes, keep an eye on comfyui PRs. Many end up in the UI.

## Useful things
* Upscale Database: https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Model_Database
  * note: stick to the universals unless there's one that fits specific needs
  * I often use 2xPNSR for quick upscales (first line, in source section).
  * lollypop x4 is my favorite for illustration style images.
* [A handy chart of aspect ratios](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9657443/231819299-77de2080-7b04-4512-9922-56faec2596b8.png) from a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/10wqv7r/when_it_comes_to_printing_converting_resolutions/)
* [MisterRuffian's Latent Artist & Modifier Encyclopedia](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_jgQ9SyvUaBNP1mHHEzZ6HhL_Es1KwBKQtnpnmWW82I/edit#gid=1807667703)

## Useful Things
* [XNView](https://www.xnview.com/en/) a great, light-weight and impressively capable file viewer. It shows the workflow stored in the exif data (View→Panels→Information). Also has favorite folders to make moving and sortintg images from `./output` easier. There may be something better out there for this, but I've not found it.
